# Password_Generator

<p>
This is very simple code to generate passwords. I created this script to reduce my thinking capasity to generate a password for extra stuff.No additional module is required. You just need to be installed python only. You can run this code on your phone also. Install any python running IDE for phone and run the script according to the requirement/procedure of that IDE. <i>Have fun coders!</i>
